\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:sec008}

In this document, we identified how the levels of assertiveness will impact the radiologists' decision-making process.
Our work contributes to understand this level of impact by conducting a Clinician-Centered Design (CCD) of {\it BreastScree\-ning-AI}~\textemdash~a system that enables clinicians to accept or reject the AI breast analysis with an assertiveness-based communication.
Ultimately, we propose a series of recommendations for a CCD development around assertiveness-based interaction in breast cancer diagnosis.
From here, we will apply the proposed system to understand the clinicians' behaviour during the decision-making process in a real-world setting.
