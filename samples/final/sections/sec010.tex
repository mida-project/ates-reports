\caption{When the clinician press the "Accept" button, the system will trigger two minor scenario options: (a) {\bf Active}; or (b) {\bf Passive}. During our sessions of low-fi prototype co-design with clinicians, all of them preferred the (b) {\bf Passive} option.}

\caption{Here, we propose the suggested system resulted from a preliminary evaluation. From this proposed system, we will be able to understand when ({\it e.g.}, {\bf Proactive} {\it vs} {\bf Reactive}) and how ({\it e.g.}, {\bf Assertive} {\it vs} {\bf Non-Assertive}) should the assistant agent adapt and change the behaviour per each group ({\it i.e.}, Interns, Juniors, Middles and Seniors) of medical experience. In this case, we have an {\bf Assertive} communication with the second screen of a {\bf Reactive} agent.}
