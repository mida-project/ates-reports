The hereby repository represents several [samples](samples/) of [readings](samples/READINGS.md) from the [Advanced Topics in Human-Computer Interaction](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/TAIP-M/2018-2019/1-semestre) (ATHCI) course of the [Computer Science and Engineering Doctoral Program](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/curriculo) at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt) (IST) of [Universidade de Lisboa](https://www.ulisboa.pt/) (ULisboa) - [Portugal](https://www.portugal.gov.pt/en/). The goal of this [readings](samples/READINGS.md) is to write an essay ([ACM Format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)) about the topics of each seminar. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory, while the *samples* can be found at [`samples/`](samples/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
