\section{Background}
\label{sec:sec002}

Medical imaging systems allow the end-user to diagnose several modalities\footnotemark[1], such as MG, US or MRI, from a seamless retrieval medical imaging data~\cite{faraji2019radiologic}.
By bringing those modalities together, it offers new possibilities for quantitative imaging and diagnosis but also requires specialized data handling, post-processing and novel visualization methods~\cite{Igarashi:2016:IVS:2984511.2984537}.
In the clinical domain, medical imaging tools can help experts make better decisions, {\it e.g.}, by identifying cancer prognostics among the available multi-modal data~\cite{Lopes:2017:UHC:3143820.3144118}.
