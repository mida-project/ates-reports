\begin{abstract}

This report provides the analysis and debate of a \textit{Medical Imaging Diagnosis Assertiveness Alignment} proposal.
In context of this document, it was created for the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/TASE4/2019-2020/2-semestre}{Advanced Topics in Entertainment Systems (ATES)} course of the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/curriculo}{Computer Science and Engineering Doctoral Program (PDEI)} at \hyperlink{https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/}{IST} from \hyperlink{https://www.ulisboa.pt/}{ULisboa} - \hyperlink{https://www.portugal.gov.pt/en/}{Portugal} (\hyperlink{https://europa.eu}{EU}).

This document describes a proposal development and concept of a study to understand how the level of assertiveness, displayed by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant agent, will impact the radiologists' decision-making process during breast cancer diagnosis.
We will develop a proof-of-concept prototype, a medical imaging assistant, with two scenarios of the assistant behaviour:
(1) one scenario for an Assertive assistant; and
(2) a second scenario for a Non-Assertive assistant.
We will conduct a 2x4, between subjects experiment (n = 10 expected), in which the two Assertive and Non-Assertive subjects will be matched with the four categories of radiologists' professional experience, {\it i.e.}, Interns, Juniors, Middles and Seniors.
From a latter study, we will extract the rates of False-Positives (FPs) and False-Negatives (FNs) to understand patterns of critical behaviour among the four categories of professional experience.
In the end, we will propose several strategies that we expect to promote the unbiased behaviour per each category of professional experience, improving the False-Positives and False-Negatives rates during diagnostic.
