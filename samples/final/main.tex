\begin{abstract}

This report provides information concerning the study for the \textit{Impact of Assertiveness-based Interaction in Medical Imaging Diagnosis}.
In context of this document, it was created for the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/TASE4/2019-2020/2-semestre}{Advanced Topics in Entertainment Systems (ATES)} course of the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/curriculo}{Computer Science and Engineering Doctoral Program (PDEI)} at \hyperlink{https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/}{Instituto Superior T\'{e}cnico (IST)} from \hyperlink{https://www.ulisboa.pt/}{University of Lisbon (ULisboa)} - \hyperlink{https://www.portugal.gov.pt/en/}{Portugal} (\hyperlink{https://europa.eu}{EU}).

This document describes the final project of a study to understand how the level of assertiveness, displayed by an assistant agent, will impact the radiologists' decision-making process during breast cancer diagnosis.
We will develop a proof-of-concept prototype, a medical imaging assistant, with two major scenarios of the assistant behaviour:
(1) one scenario for an Assertive assistant; and
(2) a second scenario for a Non-Assertive assistant;
paired with two assistant behaviours:
(i) Proactive; and
(ii) Reactive.
We will conduct a 4x4, within-subjects experiment (n = 10), in which the four Assertive, Non-Assertive, Proactive and Reactive subjects will be matched with the four categories of radiologists' professional experience, {\it i.e.}, Interns, Juniors, Middles and Seniors.
From a latter study, we will extract the rates of False-Positives (FPs) and False-Negatives (FNs) to understand patterns of critical behaviour among the four categories of professional experience.
In the end, we will propose several strategies that we expect to promote the unbiased behaviour per each category of professional experience, improving the FPs and FNs rates during diagnostic.
