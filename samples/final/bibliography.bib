abstract="Medical imaging registration is a critical step in a wide spectrum of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy and has been an extensively studied research field. Prior to the popularity of deep learningDeep learning, image registrationImage registration was commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric as a cost function in search for the optimal registration. However, the optimization task is known to be challenging due to (1) the non-convex nature of the matching metric over the registration parameter space and (2) the lack of effective approaches for robust optimization. With the latest advance in deep learningDeep learning and artificial intelligence, the field of medical image registrationImage registration had a major paradigm shift, whereby learning-based image registrationImage registration methods are developed to employ deep neural networks to analyze images in order to estimate plausible registrations. Among the latest advances in learning-based registration methods, agent-based methods have been shown to be effective in both 3-D/3-D and 2-D/3-D registrations with significant robustness advantage over conventional optimization-based methods. In this chapter, we give an overview of agent-based methods for medical image registrationImage registration and its two applications on rigid-body 3-D/3-D and 2-D/3-D registrations.",

abstract="The need for explainability of AI algorithms has been identified in the literature for some time now. However, recently became even more important due to new data protection act rules (GDPR 2018) and due to the requirements for wider applicability of AI to several application areas. BT's autonomics team has recognized this through several sources and identified the vitality of AI algorithms explainability to ensure their adoption and commercialization. In this paper, we designed and developed a system providing explanations for a prediction of patient readmittance using machine learning. The requirements and the evaluation were set by BT through their projects with real-customers in the medical domain. A logistic regression machine learning algorithm was implemented with explainability ``hooks'' embedded in its code and the corresponding interfaces to the users of the system were implemented through a web interface. Python-based technologies were utilized for the implementation of the algorithm (Scikit-learn) and the web interface (web2py), and the system was evaluated through thorough testing and feedback. Initial trade-off analysis of such an approach that presents the overhead introduced by adding explainability versus the benefits was performed. Lastly, conclusions and future work are presented, considering experimentation with more algorithms and application of software engineering methods such as abstraction to the aid of explainable AI, leading further along to ``explainability by design''.",

abstract = "We propose a new method for breast cancer screening from DCE-MRI based on a post-hoc approach that is trained using weakly annotated data (i.e., labels are available only at the image level without any lesion delineation). Our proposed post-hoc method automatically diagnosis the whole volume and, for positive cases, it localizes the malignant lesions that led to such diagnosis. Conversely, traditional approaches follow a pre-hoc approach that initially localises suspicious areas that are subsequently classified to establish the breast malignancy – this approach is trained using strongly annotated data (i.e., it needs a delineation and classification of all lesions in an image). We also aim to establish the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches when applied to breast screening from DCE-MRI. Relying on experiments on a breast DCE-MRI dataset that contains scans of 117 patients, our results show that the post-hoc method is more accurate for diagnosing the whole volume per patient, achieving an AUC of 0.91, while the pre-hoc method achieves an AUC of 0.81. However, the performance for localising the malignant lesions remains challenging for the post-hoc method due to the weakly labelled dataset employed during training."
