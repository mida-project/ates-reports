\begin{abstract}

This report provides the reading analysis and debate of an \textit{Acoustic Livestock Monitoring Proposal} document supported by the \hyperlink{https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth}{AudioMoth} device.
In context of this document, it was created for the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/disciplinas/TAIP-M/2018-2019/1-semestre}{Advanced Topics in Human-Computer Interaction} course of the \hyperlink{https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/curriculo}{Computer Science and Engineering Doctoral Program} at \hyperlink{https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/}{IST} of \hyperlink{https://www.ulisboa.pt/}{ULisboa} - \hyperlink{https://www.portugal.gov.pt/en/}{Portugal} (\hyperlink{https://europa.eu}{EU}).

This document describes a proposal development and concept of an acoustic detector, namely called as \textit{AudioMoth}.
It is briefly outlined several potential case studies of monitoring animal for livestock production.
As an example, it is used the animal counting, illness or even giving birth, between others, as hypothetical application.
With this proposal, it can be demonstrated the potential of \textit{AudioMoth} to enable substantial conversion from passive continuous recording by individual devices, towards smart detection by networks of devices, automatically addressing several animal characteristics.
One characteristic, can be the communications between animals, taking into account the animal sound patterns of a livestock production.
Since the fact that, in a period of time, each animal communicate at least one time.
From here, an algorithm for logging animal sound events, has the potential to identify animal issues on a herd during that period of time.
With this idea, livestock productions could benefit from an autonomous monitoring process of the animal herds.
Observing animal patterns and managing animal issues.
